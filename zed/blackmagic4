📥 Cloning
What: Makes a local copy of any repository (original or forked) to your computer.

Where: Happens on your local machine using the git clone command.

Why: You want to work on code locally — edit, run, test, and push changes.

Example use case: After forking a repo on GitHub, you clone it to your PC to start coding.

Think of cloning as "downloading a working copy of a Git repo".

👨‍🔧 Common Workflow Example:
